# Vue.js-Coffee-Website
Totally own project in Vue.js for fun and gathering all those new tricks together.


Initial idea: http://imgur.com/a/WFJWd

What's this all about:
So I thought I will give it a go and create something own with Vue.js to practice all those event buses, props, routing etc.
The idea is to make a small NoSQL database with Firebase to store coffee recipes.
While design of the website is not my main goal, I plan to use CSS grid and RWD.
